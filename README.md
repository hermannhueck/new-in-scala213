# New in Scala 2.13
  
This presentation shows the feature updates from Scala 2.12 to 2.13.
The list of features is not comprehensive, but it is my personal selection of favorites.
I will focus on those features which IMO impact/ease the programmers live most.

I will look at 5 feature areas: compiler, standard library, language changes,
Future and finally collections which have been redesinged in 2.13.
