# What's new in Scala 2.13?
  
This presentation shows the feature updates from Scala 2.12 to 2.13.
The list of features is not comprehensive, but it is my personal selection of favorites.
I will focus on those which IMO impact/ease the programmers live most.

I will look at 5 feature areas: compiler, standard library, language changes,
Future and finally the most important change the redesigned collections library.

I will not only show the new features of 2.13. In many cases I will show how the
new features of 2.13 can be backported to 2.12 und be used in mostly the same way as in 2.13.

Finally I'll give some guide lines for the migration from 2.12 to 2.13 and for a cross version
project which compiles a code base with both compiler versions.
